title: Starting the Development Environment
---
Our app uses the [Electron JS](https://www.electronjs.org/) library in conjunction with [React JS](https://react.dev/). In order to start the development environment:

1. Open the terminal
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project
3. Enter the command "npm run start"

The electron app will launch and you can test your changes. Any changes made to the React application can be immediately viewed after reloading the Electron window through the "View" menu or by pressing "Command+R" on Mac or "Ctrl+R" on Windows. Any changes made to the Electron side of the application can only be viewed after restarting the development environment. You can stop the development environment server in the terminal by pressing "Ctrl+C"
